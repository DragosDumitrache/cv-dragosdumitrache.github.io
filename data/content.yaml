Profile: Once upon a time, a nerd that got into software engineering for the fun of it. Along the way, he discovered the joy of breaking a problem down to its smallest piece, and using that to build a solution. This has led him in a never ending pursuit of elegance in all aspects of development.
Experience:
- Employer: XCharta
  Place: London, UK
  Positions:
    - Title: Founding Engineer
      Date: Sep 2023 - Oct 2023
      Badges: [ 'Python', 'Flask', 'GCP' ]
      Details:
        - Introduced infrastructure-as-code to standardise the development and shape of the platform, ensuring all our existing and future environments look and behave in a consistent manner.
        - Created dashboards and metrics for observability, allowing us to better handle and investigate any potential issues.
        - Improved resilience and performance of the platform by decoupling heavy-duty processes from the main service, and by leveraging asynchronous requests between them.
    - Title: Contracting Engineer
      Date: Jul 2023 - Sep 2023
      Badges: [ 'Python', 'Flask', 'GCP' ]
      Details:
        - Advised and assisted with the development of the platform, guiding its implementation to a more production grade state.

- Employer: GoCardless
  Place: London, UK
  Positions:
    - Title: Site Reliability Engineer
      Date: Jun 2022 - Jun 2023
      Badges: [ 'Go', 'Terraform', 'K8s', 'Helm', 'Ruby' ]
      Details:
        - Led the documentation consolidation efforts and fostered a knowledge-sharing culture through the creation of a knowledge base. 
          This encouraged people to self-serve whenever possible and resulted in an increased sense of ownership.
        - Guided developers on running <b>production grade</b> systems via Kubernetes and Terraform, supporting the migration efforts from a monolithic system to a service-oriented architecture.
        - Spearheaded the modernisation effort of the tech stack through the upgrade of our GKE clusters, terraform modules and open source projects, reducing maintenance toil.
        - Contributed to the company wide cost saving initiative through CI pipeline improvements, saving on average <b>15000 minutes per week</b> and approximately <b>$120 000 a year</b>.
    - Title: Software Engineer
      Date: Sep 2021 - Jun 2022
      Badges: [ 'Ruby', 'Terraform', 'GKE', 'Jsonnet' ]
      Details:
        - Led the design of a recurring payment scheme and its API implementation, aiming for cross-region compatibility.
        - Assisted with the development of a unified payment gateway service and API that enabled customers to leverage European open-banking capabilities.
        - Collaborated on the redesign of a Ruby monolith logic into smaller, independent, services, with well defined API boundaries and responsibilities.
- Employer: Upside Technologies
  Place: London, UK
  Badges: [ 'Python', 'Java', 'Django', 'AWS', 'K8S' ]
  Positions:
    - Title: Software Engineer
      Date: Nov 2020 - Aug 2021
      Details:
        - Optimised and decoupled the overall performance that assessed the performance of all investments in a portfolio, reducing the runtime 6 fold.
        - Contributed to the development of a monolithic social trading platform.
        - Created a BDD testing DSL to increase development speed, improve confidence in the platform and offer developers an easier way to write tests.
- Employer: Anaplan
  Place: London, UK
  Badges: [ 'Java', 'Python', 'Rust', 'Terraform' ]
  Positions:
    - Title: Software Engineer
      Date: Sep 2020 - Oct 2020
    - Title: Associate Software Engineer
      Date: Jul 2017 - Sep 2020
      Details:
        - Worked primarily in R&D around an in-memory distributed computation engine, backed by an event-driven architecture, ingesting data and performing calculations and aggregations on sparsely populated datasets.
        - Helped define the architecture of the different components the system was made up of, including the optimisation engine around it. This optimisation engine leveraged concepts from Information Theory and Knowledge Representation to reduce complexity and improve performance.
        - Improved performance 100-fold based on metrics analysis, saving tens of thousands of pounds per year. On a cold start, we were aggregation 10 trillion sparsely populated cells across a 15 quintillion space
        - Helped add sparse time-based calculation support to the legacy system, dealing with cyclic calculations and building a formal specification for this feature, which increased confidence in the correctness of the results without the need for extensive manual testing.
